# Review

These are the questions from the textbook that I recommend you work through in preparation for the exam. All solutions are available at: [https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/](https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/).

In addition, if you have questions about the practice exam, you can ask your tutor. Having a general question and answer session with your tutor would be a good way to use the time.
