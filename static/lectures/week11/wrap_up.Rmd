    - Key concepts


]]
.column[.top50px[

- What .orange[type of problem] do you have? 
    - supervised (regression, classification), 
    - unsupervised (PCA, cluster analysis)
- Should you use a .orange[flexible or less flexible] model? 
    - Parametric (more assumptions, easier estimation, strong inference)
    - Non-parametric (more flexible, fewer assumptions, more observations needed, less interpretable)
        - e.g. kNN, smoothers
- .orange[Measuring fit]
    - MSE, $R^2$, BIC
    - accuracy, misclassification
- .orange[Bias vs variance] trade-off
    - bias: error that is introduced by modeling a complicated problem by a simpler model
    - variance: how much your estimate would change if you had different training data

# After this course


.green[**ETC3555 - Statistical Machine Learning**]

.font_small[This unit covers the methods and practice of statistical machine learning for modern data analysis problems. Topics covered will include recommender systems, social networks, text mining, matrix decomposition and completion, and sparse multivariate methods. All computing will be conducted using the R programming language.

Prerequisites: ETC3250 or FIT3154]
]]
.column[.padtop50px[
.green[**ETC5550 - Advanced Statistical Modelling**] 

.font_small[This unit introduces extensions of linear regression models for handling a wide variety of data analysis problems. Three extensions will be considered: generalised linear models for handling counts and binary data; mixed-effect models for handling data with a grouped or hierarchical structure; and non-parametric regression for handling non-linear relationships. All computing will be conducted using R.

Prerequisites: ETC2410, ETC2420, ETC3440 or equivalent.]

For those of you wrapping up your studies, good luck in your future, and I hope that what you have learned in this class can be useful in your journey.

My data analyses, slides, papers, web site uses the [R](https://www.r-project.org) .orange[workflow]. Very powerful framework for a business analyst/data scientist. There is .orange[no competition] with [python](https://www.python.org). Both extraordinary resources for our world. The people who develop and maintain these resources need our applause. We are extremely .orange[lucky] to be living in a world where these resources are available free to us.
